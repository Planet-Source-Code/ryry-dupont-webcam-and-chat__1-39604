you need the bmp2jpeg.dll file ...you can get it at:

http://plaza.ufl.edu/rdupont/vb/Bmp2Jpeg.dll

i believe you need to put the bmp2jpeg.dll in the windows\system folder...
sometimes it works if it is just in the same folder as the program, but 
sometimes it doesnt...in any case, it is safer to put in the system folder
